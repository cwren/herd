# Contributing

This is a small project run by volunteers. Moderate your expectations
appropriately, please.

## Issues 

The best, first step in contributing is to look at the
[issues](https://github.com/cwren/herd/issues), including
[closed issues](https://github.com/cwren/herd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed),
to see if the improvement you wish to make is already under
discussion. If it is not, please file a new issue with a description
of what improvement you believe needs to be make, and why.

## Pull Requests

Currently netlify is configured to create a preview build for any
branch pushed to the repository.  Code reviews should include a link
to this preview as a check that no new files or dependencies were
forgotten.

We have witnessed Astro builds on netlify fail despite local builds
succeeding, so seeing a successful preview deploy is considered
a hard prerequisite to merging into main, and therefore production.
